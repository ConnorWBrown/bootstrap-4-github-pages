Are you on this page looking for purely professional qualifications? None will be found here!

This is a space for my other interests, where you can better get to know me as a person.

With that whole interdisciplinary schtick mentioned elsewhere, I enjoy a pretty wide variety of things outside of what I may get to use directly in the workplace. The most immediate and impactful of these interests would probably be martial arts, juggling, rock climbing, music, and reading.

I’ve been participating in various martial arts since I was seven (plenty of awards and belts and whatnot, but really I’m interested in the art and biomechanics of it), juggling since I was nine (working on nine balls on a good day!), and am halfway through more books than I care to admit (recommendations, musings, and my current to-read list [here]).  I’ve been playing various  instruments for… who knows how long, and enjoy picking up new ones when I can! Mandolin, viola, and vocal harmony being the main contenders at the moment.

[Reach out](mailto:{{ site.email }})--I’m always excited to share interests or pick your brain.
