I like working with people to figure out complex problems.

These crop up frequently in [neuroscience research]( /research/ ), specifically neuromodulation.

The huge variety of approaches available to us by way of [software and hardware development]( /technical/ ) are fascinating, especially advances that help us gain [new insights from data]( /data_sci/ ) regardless of the field and data type.

I studied Cognitive Science, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

My interests also [extend to a love of]( /life/ ) martial arts, rock climbing, juggling, and reading.

Recently, I’ve been working on designing, building, programming, and testing a novel [neurostimulation device]( /projects/magnetic_perturbation/ ) with Professor Rich Ivry and the UC Berkeley Brain Imaging Center as a project manager and R&D developer.
