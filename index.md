### I'm a data-focused researcher, designer, and developer.

I like working with people to figure out complex problems.

These crop up frequently in neuroscience research, specifically neuromodulation.

The huge variety of approaches we can take through software and hardware development are fascinating, especially with regard to our ability to process data and learn new things regardless of the field and data type.

My interests also extend to a love of martial arts, rock climbing, juggling, and reading.

Recently, I’ve been working on [proj], [proj], [proj].
