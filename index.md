I like working with people to figure out complex problems.

These crop up frequently in [neuroscience research]( /research/ ), specifically neuromodulation.

The huge variety of approaches we can take through [software and hardware development]( /technical/ ) are fascinating, especially advances that help us gain [new insights from data]( /data_sci/ ) regardless of the field and data type.

My interests also [extend to a love of]( /life/ ) martial arts, rock climbing, juggling, and reading.

Recently, I’ve been working on [proj], [proj], [proj].

[Reach out](mailto:{{ site.email }})--I’m always excited to share interests or pick your brain.
