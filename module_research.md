<!--#### I'm a data-focused researcher, designer, and developer.-->
<br>

Analogous to the "teaching a man to fish" fable, my talents and skills lend themselves to enabling others to conduct research. I am interested in the design and improvement of neuroscience methods, therefore enabling others’ research to be more effective. I studied Cognitive Science, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, combining my interest in the three and using these skills to pursue my interest in neuroscience methods research.

I have worked in the UC Berkeley Cognition and Action Lab for the last two years, with my main focus being the design, development, and testing of a novel neurostimulation device. As project manager and developer for the neurostimulation device fabrication project, I have been immersed in the design, build, and testing process as well as grant-writing, technical writing, and subject testing. I have also been the connection between the neuroscientists and the engineers, enabling effective communication and logistical support. I have been hands-on in the build process itself, making and testing prototypes of the eventual device and designing subcomponents.

I’ve also worked on modeling activity in the movement-ipsilateral motor cortex, and on time perception brain stimulation research.
