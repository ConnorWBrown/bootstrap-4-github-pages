#### I'm a data-focused researcher, designer, and developer.
<br>

I find the challenge of software development fascinating, solving abstract problems and implementing them on the ground, fully functional. I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, gaining fluency in programming, circuits, and algorithm design with an emphasis on data scence, user interfacing, and artificial intelligence. I thrive in environments where I can bridge the gap between the technical and the day-to-day, providing insight to those with less-technical backgrounds and turning their ideas into concrete implementations.

The Computer Science program at Cal focuses on project-based learning, giving students the know-how to solve problems, not just regurgitate information. This doubles as a means of learning a variety of languages, because each class teaches its conceptual information in whatever language is best suited to learning it.

I spent a year running internal database management for the Berkeley Student Cooperative housing nonprofit, translating between the daily needs of those interfacing with the system and the capabilities of the system. I trained and supervised employees as they interacted with the database and helped with their technical and nontechnical needs.

In my last couple of years at the UC Berkeley Cognition and Action Lab, I have gained valuable skills in data processing, software design, analysis, and human-computer interaction. Throughout, I worked closely with a small group: receiving raw data from other team members who collected from the initial source (sub-skull electrodes in the human brain), then writing up and presenting my findings to other members for use in final overall reports and papers. I worked with massive raw neural data streams, writing pipeline programs to extract, clean, transform, and integrate data from multiple sources. I then trained predictive models on these data in order to mimic the functionality of the human motor cortex. I was also involved in a project management and development role as one project within my lab shifted to product creation and company incorporation. Lab has taught me to pick up skills quickly, apply myself as a self-motivated member of a team, and follow through with long term goals.
