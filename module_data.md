<!--#### I'm a data-focused researcher, designer, and developer.-->
<br>

We have massive amounts of data flowing around us all the time, and our generation is uniquely poised to take advantage of this deluge with the computing and statistical power at our fingertips. I am eager to apply my research background and technical experience to a tangible, real-world environment, and dig in. I have worked in several positions requiring hands-on data processing, analytics, and software development/testing using Python and SQL (including packages such as PANDAS, TensorFlow, matplotlib, and NumPy), and taken significant coursework in Data Science, Python, Java, frontend/JS, SQL, and more.

As I worked my way through the UC Berkeley Data Science curriculum, I gained
hands-on project-based experience programming, alongside the underlying algorithmic
and booksmart knowledge. The Data Science program gave me the skills and confidence to
integrate my computer science background with my statistical skills and scientific approach
to problem solving.

I am currently working on ETL and data analysis in a neuroscience lab, receiving raw data from other team members who collected from the initial source (sub-skull electrodes in the human brain), then writing up and presenting my findings to other members for use in final overall reports and papers. I worked with massive raw neural data streams, writing pipeline programs to extract, clean, transform, and integrate data from multiple sources. I then trained predictive models on these data in order to mimic the functionality of the human motor cortex.

I am actively pursuing opportunities in data analytics, data engineering, and software development--anything within the scope of data, software, creativity, and analytics.
