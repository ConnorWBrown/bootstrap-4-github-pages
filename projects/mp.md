#### Designing new ways to probe brain activity.
<br>

Many of the most impactful shifts in neuroscience in recent decades have been due to the massive leaps made in the supporting technologies. One domain where we've seen tremendous improvement is the use of non-invasive brain stimulation. However, our ability to induce plasticity (the cellular basis for all learning) has lagged due to issues of replicability and efficacy. To bridge the gap between our cellular understanding of the brain (long term potentiation of cells and the )

For the last year I have been working with a small group of professors and researchers to design and fabricate a novel neurostimulation device (inducing plasticity in targeted regions of the brain).
Wrote hardware control programs for the device, while iteratively building and testing prototypes and substructures of the final version.
Performed research and technical writing for patents, grant applications, and human subjects protocols.
Ran subjects in a pilot study and analyzed their data.
Aiming to finalize our first fully-functional prototype this summer and begin running studies.
