#### Designing new ways to probe brain activity.
<br>

Many of the most impactful shifts in neuroscience in recent decades have been due to the massive leaps 
made in the supporting technologies. One domain where we've seen tremendous improvement is the use of 
non-invasive brain stimulation. However, our ability to induce plasticity (the cellular basis for all 
learning) has lagged due to issues of replicability and efficacy. My lab has been working to bridge 
the gap between our cellular understanding of this mechanism (long term potentiation of cells) and
our ability to experimentally probe it in vivo. We developed a completely novel approach to triggering
this cellular learning mechanism while simultaneously eliminating the safety concerns inherent the
current state-of-the-art technique for doing so, opening up an entirely new experimental space.

For the last two years (2017-2019) I have been working with a small group of professors and researchers
to design and fabricate a novel neurostimulation device (inducing plasticity in targeted regions of the 
brain). I wrote hardware control programs for the device, while iteratively building and testing 
prototypes and substructures of the final version.
I also performed research and technical writing for patents, grant applications, and human subjects protocols.

As of August 2019, our first fully-functional prototype is up and running and we are actively performing
tests to characterize the system and prepare for human trials.
